Bolderslant is just handwritten font with thick line and slant style.

When making this font I started by writing a few words using a digital drawing application, then I continued to complete all the letters, numbers and punctuation marks until I was done. Then I compiled it in a vector application before I finally put it in a font maker application.

And the image below shows how this font is used in a pangram.
